This is a command line client for the wegggmbh.de food order server in go. It can show the placed orders, place orders, cancel orders and save a backup of the placed orders as text-file.

There is also a python script where you can fill in your username and password and set a file path to create backups of your placed orders. With this python script, you can automate the backup process.
Be aware that having your username and password in this python script means, that it is stored in plain text. This is considered unsafe! Be careful!
